This project demonstrates how to use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as a templating engine to render dynamic content in a web application. 
It provides examples of how EJS can simplify building reusable components, handle dynamic routing, and inject backend data into the frontend.

**Overview**
This project is intended to demonstrate the power and flexibility of EJS for rendering HTML templates with data from a backend. 
EJS allows you to embed JavaScript directly into your HTML files, making it easy to pass data from your backend to the frontend.

**Features**
Render dynamic content on the frontend using EJS templates.
Demonstrate loops, conditionals, and partials in EJS.
Handle dynamic routing to display specific content based on the URL.
Showcase reusable components (like headers and footers) using EJS partials.

**Technologies Used**
Backend: Node.js with Express
Templating Engine: EJS
Frontend: HTML, CSS
HTTP Server: Express (for serving EJS templates)

**Usage**
Home Page: Displays a welcome message using EJS templates.
Dynamic Pages: Visit routes like /user/:name to see EJS render personalized content dynamically.
Reusable Components: Header and footer are included using partials to demonstrate component reuse.
